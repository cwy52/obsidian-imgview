# Obsidian Imageview plugin
`ðŸš§ WIP`

Keep saving reference images but cannot find them as too many images in your device?
This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that allows you to add tags and view images by those tags! 


## Example
1. Displaying images with tag: 'icon'
```imgview
GALLERY 
WHERE tag IN ('icon')
```

## Thanks
This project is inspired by [dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/).
